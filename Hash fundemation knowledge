##Hash Table

"In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary. 
It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code,
into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, 
the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored."

is a type of data structure could be directly visted by the key point's value.

array is a type of Hash Table

##Hash Function
hashFunction = hashCode(name...)%tableSize
Generally, hashcode could make other type of data structe to become different values by special coding way.

##Hash structure
arry
set( std::set; std::multiset; std::unordered_set)
map( std::map; std::multimap; std::unordered_map)

##Conclusion
When we need to quickly determind whether an element appears in a set or not, Hash method could be considered.
